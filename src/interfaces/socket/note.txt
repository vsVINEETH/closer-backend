Your backend `SocketGateway` looks very well-structured and covers the essential features needed for real-time interactions like messaging, notifications, WebRTC signaling, and user presence. Here's a summary and some suggestions for improvement or extension:

### **Features Covered:**
1. **User Registration and Socket Management**:
   - Users are registered with their socket ID, which facilitates the routing of messages and notifications to the correct client.
   
2. **WebRTC Signaling**:
   - Handles call initiation, offer/answer exchange, and ICE candidates for WebRTC, ensuring peer-to-peer communication.

3. **Messaging**:
   - Sends messages between users and acknowledges receipt to the sender.

4. **Notifications**:
   - Sends notifications to the recipient if they are online, otherwise logs when the user is not connected.

5. **User Presence**:
   - Checks if a user is online via the `checkOnlineStatus` event and updates the user's presence status during login and logout.

6. **User Disconnection**:
   - When a user disconnects or logs out, their socket ID is removed, and other users are notified.

### **Suggestions for Improvement/Extension:**

1. **Socket Map Optimization**:
   - As the number of users grows, you may want to store socket IDs in a more scalable storage solution (e.g., Redis) rather than a `Map`. This would make it easier to handle large-scale applications, especially when scaling horizontally across multiple servers.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Consider adding more robust error handling, especially for database-related actions (like saving chat data or notifications). For instance:
     ```ts
     try {
       await chatUseCase.saveChat(data);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error("Error saving chat:", error);
     }
     ```
   - Also, handle possible errors in asynchronous functions like `notifyUserUseCase.execute(notification)` to prevent unhandled exceptions.

3. **Authentication/Authorization**:
   - While the `SocketGateway` is handling the WebSocket connection, you might want to validate user authentication before allowing them to interact with the system. You can pass a token or session ID through the socket handshake and authenticate the user server-side before processing any event.

4. **Socket Reconnection**:
   - Consider adding logic for handling socket reconnections. For instance, if a user reconnects after a disconnect, their `socket.id` might change, and you should re-register them with their updated socket ID.

5. **Message History**:
   - When a user reconnects, you might want to send a history of missed messages. You could add a feature that retrieves the chat history and sends it to the user upon reconnection.

6. **Socket Event Debouncing**:
   - Ensure that events like `notification` and `sendMessage` are not emitted multiple times for the same user in a short period (e.g., sending multiple notifications in rapid succession for the same event).

7. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - For better observability, integrate logging with tools like `winston` or `pino` to track the lifecycle of socket connections and events. You can log socket activities, errors, and state transitions in production.

### **Example Enhancements:**

#### 1. Authentication Check:
Add an authentication middleware for socket connections.
```ts
this.io.use((socket: Socket, next) => {
  const token = socket.handshake.auth.token;
  if (token && validateToken(token)) {
    next();
  } else {
    next(new Error("Unauthorized"));
  }
});
```

#### 2. Reconnection Handling:
You can manage socket reconnections with an event handler.
```ts
socket.on('reconnect', () => {
  const userId = findUserBySocketId(socket.id);
  this.userSocketMap.set(userId, socket.id);
  console.log(`User ${userId} reconnected with socket ID ${socket.id}`);
});
```

#### 3. Error Handling in `sendMessage`:
```ts
socket.on("sendMessage", async (data) => {
  try {
    const { sender, receiver, message } = data;
    await chatUseCase.saveChat(data);

    const receiverSocketId = this.userSocketMap.get(receiver._id);
    if (receiverSocketId) {
      this.io.to(receiverSocketId).emit("receiveMessage", { sender, message });
      console.log(`Message sent from ${sender} to ${receiver._id}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Receiver ${receiver._id} is not connected.`);
    }

    socket.emit("messageSent", { success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error sending message:", error);
    socket.emit("messageSent", { success: false, error: "Failed to send message" });
  }
});
```

With these improvements, your `SocketGateway` can be more resilient, maintainable, and ready for scaling and real-world production use.
